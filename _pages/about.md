 * I am in my third year of PhD studies in Computer Science at University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz.
My current research interests are neuro-symbolic AI and knowledge-aided machine learning.

 * Previously, I completed my undergraduate and master studies at The University of Edinburgh. My masters' dissertation was on speech-to-text machine translation, under the supervision of Professor Sharon Goldwater.
