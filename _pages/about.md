I am currently in my fourth year of PhD studies in Computer Science at University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz.

My research interests focus on neuro-symbolic AI and knowledge-aided machine learning.

Previously, I was part of the research team at Five AI, where I worked on 3D perception and detecting reflective symmetries in 3D models for autonomous driving. 
I completed my undergraduate and master's degrees at The University of Edinburgh, with my master's dissertation centered on speech-to-text machine translation, supervised by Professor Sharon Goldwater.
