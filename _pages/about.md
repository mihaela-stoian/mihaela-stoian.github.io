I am a final-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/), supervised by Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz.
In my research, I develop neuro-symbolic methods that integrate background knowledge constraints into neural networks, enforcing them during both training and inference. 
I am particularly interested in incorporating such constraints into deep generative models for synthesising realistic tabular data. 
During my PhD, I demonstrated that complex constraints&mdash;from linear inequalities to disjunctions over linear inequalities that model non-convex and even disconnected spaces&mdash;can be successfully integrated during training to enhance the quality of synthetic data. 

My broader research vision is to bridge the gap between neuro-symbolic AI and real-world applications to build more robust and trustworthy systems. 
Previously, I worked on detecting reflective symmetries in 3D models at [Five AI](https://www.five.ai/research).
I completed my Bachelor's and Master's at [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/), where my Master's thesis, supervised by Professor Sharon Goldwater, focused on speech-to-text machine translation.
