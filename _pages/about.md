I am a final-year PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, supervised by Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz.
During my PhD I have worked on constraining deep generative models for tabular data and incorporating logical constraints into deep learning systems, with applications such as autonomous driving. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked on 3D perception and detecting reflective symmetries in 3D models at Five AI, following my Bachelor's and Master's degree at The University of Edinburgh. 
My Master's thesis, supervised by Professor Sharon Goldwater, focused on speech-to-text machine translation.

My current research centers on knowledge-aided machine learning, with an emphasis on advancing neuro-symbolic AI to address real-world applications.
