<br>

I am in my third year of PhD studies in Computer Science at University of Oxford. My supervisor is Professor Thomas Lukasiewicz.

My current research interests are neuro-symbolic AI and knowledge-aided machine learning.

Previously, I was part of the research team at Five AI, where I worked on 3D perception and detecting reflective symmetries in 3D models for autonomous driving.
Before that, I completed my undergraduate and master studies at The University of Edinburgh. My master's dissertation was on speech-to-text machine translation, under the supervision of Professor Sharon Goldwater.
